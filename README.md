This repository contains a schoolar project I made to apply the basic concepts of OOP using Java
In this project I create a program for a restaurant, which is capable of register new customers, new meals, register new tables available in the restaurant and more.
To achieve this, I work with a DB using MySQL Workbench and establising a connection through Java to store all the data into the DB.
The main goal of this project is to apply the basic concepts of OOP, like classes, inheritance, interfaces, methods, scopes and more.
