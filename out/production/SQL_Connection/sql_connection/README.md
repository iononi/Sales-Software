## Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming Project

In this project, I establish connection to a experimental DB named
**restaurante**. The main purpose of this project is to apply all the
OOP concepts learnt in the course of **Fundamentos de POO**. Applying 
concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, methods, interfaces
and Java Swing GUI Forms.
